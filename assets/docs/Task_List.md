# Developer Task List

## Why is this here?

Until Developer Book is integrated fully, I want a place to keep track of the things that would be included in the Developer Book.

## What's going on?

I have begun to add in a goals object to the server that will begin my placement of Devbook within this application. Once this is finished, I will be able to fully create a goal, or additional objects as defined as "DevBook Pages", and add it to the database. Once the fullness of that is completed, I will be able to remove this. Until that point, **THIS** should remain the primary place to track the tasks that need to be completed.
