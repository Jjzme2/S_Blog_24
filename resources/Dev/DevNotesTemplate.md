# Dev Notes

The notes within this should be helpful to the developer relating to **this specific area** of code.
This is not intended to be a replacement for the code comments, but rather a place to put
information that is not appropriate for code comments.

## Notes:

1. Remove the 'Template' part of this file so we can be sure it is removed using our gitIgnore.
   `**/DevNotes.md`.
